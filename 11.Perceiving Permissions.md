1. Channging File Ownership
### Solve
To solve this challenge we need to first use the chown command to change the ownership from root to use here hacker and then cat the file to get the flag 
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ chown hacker /flag
$ cat /flag
```
## Flag: 

```

### New Learnings
From this this challenge , I have learnt that we can change the ownership of a file using chown files to view some files that cant originally be viewed by the user .
To tell about this in detail :
Root is the administrative account with the ultimate, unrestricted privileges.
Permissions are set to control access; for example, the /flag file is owned by root and set so only root can read it, denying the hacker user access.
The chown command is used to change a file's owner to a different user.Only the root user can typically run chown.
Changing a file's owner would grant the new owner all the rights over that file, allowing them to read it.

## Challenge 2
2. Groups and Files  
### Solve
 In this challenge we use ls -l command to list out all the files so that we can identify in which file the flag is in . After identifying the file we can use the chgrp command to change the group to hacker and then we can cat the file to get the flag  

#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ ls -l
$ chgrp hacker /flag
$ cat /flag 
```
## Flag:

### New Learnings
Every file in Linux is owned by both a user and a group.A single group can contain multiple users, and a single user can be a member of multiple groups.Groups are the most common way to control access to system resources, files, and devices.
From this challenge we have learnt that we can use the chgrp command to change the groups.

## Challenge 
3. Fun with Groups Names 

### Solve
To solve this challenge we need to firs check we need to identify our group name by id comand and then from there we need to change the group of the file /flag and then cat it like the last challenge 
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ id
$ chgrp grp25005 /flag
$ cat /flag

```
## Flag: 

```

```
### New Learnings
In this challenge we learnt to find our user in the group by using 'id'.

4. Changng Permissions 

### Solve
In this we need to chmod command to change the permissions of a  file and then cat it to get the file  .
Here in the command we have a+r becaus a is for all and + is for allows and r is for read so it allows all users to read the file.
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ chmod a+r /flag
$ cat /flag 
```
## Flag: 

```

```
### New Learnings
In this challenge we have learnt:
Character	Name	Description
u	User (Owner)	The file's owner.
g	Group	Users who are members of the file's group.
o	Other	All users who are not the owner and not in the group.
a	All	    shorthand for u,g,o

Character	Name	Description
+	        Add	  Adds the specified permission(s) to the user class
-	     Remove Removes the specified permission(s) from the user class

5. Executabe files 

### Solve
 To solve this challenge we need to first change the permissions of the command and then we can run the command and get the flag .
 Here we have used a+x beacuse beacuse a is all and + is for allows and x is execute so it allows everyone to execute 
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ chmod a+x /challenge/run
$ /challenge/run
```

6. Permission Tweaing Practice 

### Solve
In this we need to set the set the permission nearly 8 times and then finally we can get the flag 
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ /challenge/run
$ chmod a-r /challenge/pwn
$ chmod a+wx /challenge/pwn
$ chmod uo-x /challenge/pwn
$ chmod u+x /challenge/pwn
$ chmod go+rwx /challenge/pwn
$ chmod a-rx /challenge/pwn
$ chmod a+rwx /challenge/pwn
$ chmod uo-wx /challenge/pwn
$ chmod a+r /flag
$ cat /flag
```
## Flag:

7. Permissions setting practice

### Solve
In this we need to set the set the permission nearly 8 times and then finally we can get the flag 
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ /challenge/run
$ chmod u=x,g=rx,o=wx /challenge/pwn
$ chmod u=x,g=w,o=x /challenge/pwn

## Challenge 
8. The SUID Bit 

### Solve
To solve this we need to set uo SUID bit to on the program and then we have to its shell .
Then we need to find the location of the flag by ls-l
Then cat the file to get the file 
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ chmod u+s /challenge/getroot
$ /challenge/getroot
$ ls -l
$ cat /flag
```
## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{0z_zAL1x00HaGikR9d1344daE7l.QXzEjN0wSM1AzNzEzW}
```
### New Learnings
In this challenge wwe learnt about the SUID bit 
SUID is a special permission bit that allows a user to run an executable program with the permissions of the file's owner, regardless of who the executing user is.
It allows non-root users to perform system tasks that usually require elevated access (like running sudo).
When viewing file permissions (ls -l), the executable bit (x) for the owner is replaced by an s (e.g., -r**w**s**r-xr-x).
setting the SUID bit on a program owned by root can create an attack vector, allowing a vulnerability in that program to be exploited for root privilege escalation.
