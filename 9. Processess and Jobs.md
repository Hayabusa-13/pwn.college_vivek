## Challenge                                                   
1. Listing Process
### Solve
use the ps -ef or ps aux to check the files and check for any file the named with challenge or anything related to it and then run the file path to get the flag 

#### Commands run: 

```sh
$  ps -ef
$ /challenge/6181-run-22748
```
## Flag: 

```

```
### New Learnings
In this we learnt about the ps command and the extra arguments we can use like -ef or aux

2. Killing Processess
### Solve
To solve this challenge we need to find the PID of the file that is restricting us to get the flag 
Now to find this we use the ps -ef command and use grep along with it to pinpoint the file 
Now using the kill command stop the file 
Then we can use the /challenge/run to get the fflag 

#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ ps -ef | grep /challenge/dont_run
$ hacker       136     135  0 17:38 ?        00:00:00 /challenge/dont_run
$ kill 136
$ /challenge/run
```
## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{Yh1z4UNlYSHetkF2OWxWu685FD3.QXyQDO0wSM1AzNzEzW}
```
### New Learnings
We learnt the use of kill command ussing the asic default options 
and there was a quick recap of the grep command which made it easier to solve the challenge

3. Interrupting Processess
### Solve
In this we use the Ctrl + C key to stop the running process and get the flag 

#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ /challenge/run
$ Ctrl + C key
```
## Flag: 

```

4. Killing Misbehaving Processess
### Solve
To solve this we need to identify the file and ill it by using the aux comand and then kill command .
After kiling we can run the challenge command and then we need to then cat it and then we need to stop the outpt when then repeat it to get the flag.
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ ps aux | grep /challenge/decoy
$ kill 142
$ /challenge/run
$ ctrl +z
$ cat /tmp/flag_fifo
$ ctrl +c 
$ /challenge/run
$ cat /tmp/flag_fifo
```
## Flag: 

```

5. Suspending Procesess 
### Solve
We need to first run the command and then use the Ctrl + Z key which suspends the terminal and opens a new one and when the command is ran again we get the flag  
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ /challenge/run
$ Ctrl + Z
$ /challenge/run
```
## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{sNOVQoS0A11jGoqZ5J8B3EQCSkJ.QX1QDO0wSM1AzNzEzW}
 ```
### New Learnings
In this we learnt what the Ctrl + Z key does int he linux terminal ; It suspends a terminal and opens a new one

6. Resumin Processess
### Solve
Inthis we run the command and then suspend it and then using the 'fg' command we resume the suspended terminal and we get the flag  
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ /challenge/run
$ Ctrl + Z
$ fg
```
## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{gGdQfjNovBRCVIndLMXHFVjox0e.QX2QDO0wSM1AzNzEzW}
 ```
### New Learnings
In this we learnt thay when a terminal is suspended we can use the fg command to resume it

7. Backgrounding Processess
### Solve
To solve this we need to first run the command and then apply the bg command and then again run the command again to get the flag 
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ /challenge/run
$ bg
$ /challenge/run

```
## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{wfZbPh4nBMvsoBIKlCtOmKzlg0y.QX3QDO0wSM1AzNzEzW}
 ```
### New Learnings
In this we have learnt how the bg command works

8. Foregrounding Processess 
### Solve
To solve this we need to first run the command and then use the Ctrl + z key and then after suspending it we have to use the bg command and then use the fg command to get the flag 
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ /challenge/run
$ bg
$ fg

```
## Flag: 

```
 pwn.college{g26ujFKMjCNymUiLX0IgL6sKJ_p.QX4QDO0wSM1AzNzEzW}

### New Learnings
Learnt how the fg and b commands work.

9. Starting Backgrounded processess
### Solve
We can start the a program in background directly without suspending it . 
We can do it by adding & to the command.
When we do this we get the flag .
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ /challenge/run &
```
## Flag: 

```

 ```
### New Learnings
Learnt what & does when added afterr a command.

10. Process exit codes 
### Solve

#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ /challenge/get-code
$ echo $?
$  161
$ /challenge/submit-code 161


```
