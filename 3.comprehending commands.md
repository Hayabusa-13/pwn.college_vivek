13. finding files 
### Solve
first if use the find command using flag as argument then we are goimng tpo get a lot of permisson denied files then
we need to use 2>/dev/null to remove the files the cannot be accesed by the user. Since even this prints a lot of files to check we need to user ```type f``` and ```-readable``` and ```-exec grep''{}``` command
to pinpoint the output . So Basically here we are incliding find and grep command in one go. 
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$   find / -name flag
$   find / -name flag 2>/dev/null
$ find / -type f -readable -name flag -exec grep -1 'pwn.college{' {} + 2>/dev/null

```
## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{ADXMWTOLHEsrDs0cD4x4JkI5iY2.QXyMDO0wSM1AzNzEzW}
 ```
### New Learnings

1. find /:
Starts the search at the filesystem root, so you don’t miss flags hidden anywhere
2. -type f:
Restricts results to regular files (not directories) .
This avoids trying to “read” directories named flag.
3. -readable:
Keeps only files your user can read. This reduces errors and wasted work when grep runs.
Without this, grep would hit lots of “Permission denied” on system paths.
4. -name flag:
Matches files named exactly “flag”.
5. -exec grep -l 'pwn.college{' {} +:
For the matched files, run grep to check contents for the actual flag pattern.
-l tells grep to print only filenames that contain the pattern, not the matching text.
{} is replaced by the found files; + batches many files per grep call (faster than running once per file with ;).
Why grep for 'pwn.college{'? Real flags follow pwn.college{...}, so this filters out decoys.
6. 2>/dev/null:
Redirects all error messages (from find and grep) to /dev/null to keep output clean (e.g., suppress Permission denied).

14.linking files 
### Solve
First link the /home/hacker/not-the-flag to v and then use the the command to print the flag
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$  ln -s /flag /home/hacker/not-the-flag
$ file /home/hacker/not-the-flag
$ cat /home/hacker/not-the-flag
$ /challenge/catflag


```
## Flag: 

```
