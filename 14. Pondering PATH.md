 Pondering PATH
## Challenge Name                                                   
1. The PATH variable 
### Solve
To solve this challenge we neeed to first remove assingn a PATH variable to a random directory or even to n othing as well as shown in the command run .
Now we can double check it by running the rm command and then after checking it we can run the command path to get the flag 
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ PATH=""
$ rm
$ /challenge/run 
```
## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{YPqCNXY9oVESW3_s__1JXiHgagb.QX2cDM1wSM1AzNzEzW}
```
### New Learnings
From this challenge we learn that , There is a special shell variable, called PATH, that stores a bunch of directory paths in which the shell will search for programs corresponding to commands

## Challenge 2
2. Setting PATH 
### Solve
 To solve this challenge we need to first include the diretory in the PATH and then run the command path to get the flag 

#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ PATH=/challenge/more_commands/
$ /challenge/run 

```
## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{Av45KE5_LZ3EIGjbIUo5bmt2tnA.QX1cjM1wSM1AzNzEzW}

## Challenge 
3. Finding Commands  

### Solve
To solve this challenge we need ot which command on win to find the directory in which flag is located and then we can use the cat command to get the flag 
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ which win
$ cat /challenge/paths/14484/win
$ cat /challenge/paths/14484/flag

```
## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{sofhqYSJNemTypq8Q7h0i44gqnA.01NzEzNxwSM1AzNzEzW}
```
### New Learnings
Mirroring what the shell does when searching for commands, which looks at each directory in $PATH in order and prints the first file it finds whose name matches the argument you passed

## Challenge 
4. Adding Commands 

### Solve
In this challenge we need to make our own win command and then we need to save it in the PATH and then we need to allow the executing funvction and then run the challenge command to ge the flag 
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$  mkdir /tmp/my_tools
$ echo 'read FLAG < /flag; echo "The flag is: $FLAG"' > /tmp/my_tools/win
$ chmod +x /tmp/my_tools/win
$ PATH="/tmp/my_tools"
$  /challenge/run
```
## Flag: 

```

## Challenge 
5. Highjacking commands 

### Solve
 To solve this challenge we need to first  make a new directory to store rm command and then make the fake rm shell script an then we need to make the script executable with the help of chmmod .
 Now we need to modify its path and then rn the challenge command to get the flag 
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$  mkdir /tmp/fake
$ echo 'read FLAG < /flag; echo "Pls honey i want to delete the flag but i cant so the flag is: $FLAG"' > /tmp/fake/rm
$ chmod +x /tmp/fake/rm
$  PATH="/tmp/fake:$PATH"
$ /challenge/run
```
## Flag: 

```
