## Challenge Name                                                   
1. Launching screen

$ screen 
```
## Flag: 

```

```
### New Learnings
From this challenge we learn that , screen is a program that creates virtual terminals inside your terminal. It's somewhat like having multiple browser tabs, but for your command line!
When you're done with your command line, type exit or press Ctrl-D to leave the screen session. Then screen will terminate and return you to your original shell.

## Challenge 2
2. Detaching and Attaching   
### Solve
 To solve this challenge we need to use the screen program and detach from it coming back to the original shell and then from there we need to run the challenge command which prints the flag the screen .
 Now to get the flag we need to attach it using scrren -r command and then we get the flag 

#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ screen 
$ Ctrl + A + d
$ /challenge/run 
$ screen -r 
```
## Flag: 

```

```
### New Learnings
From this challenge we have learnt that if you're working on something important over a remote connection, and your connection drops. With a normal terminal, everything's gone. With screen, your work keeps running, and you can reattach later!
You can also detach on purpose. You detach by pressing Ctrl-A, followed by d . This leaves your session running in the background while you return to your normal terminal.To reattach, you can use the -r argument to screen.

From this we need to attach those 3 individually and chck in which screen the flag is kept . 
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ screen -ls
$ screen -r session_b81c2ec64b677cde  {not there }
$ Ctrl + A + d
$ screen -r session_b965fbf66ee9fe42

```
## Flag:

### New Learnings
If you become an avid screen user, you will inevitably end up with multiple sessions running.We can list them using screen -ls command 
The identifiers of the sessions are the PID of each respective screen process, a dot, and the name of the screen session. To attach to a specific one, you use its name or its PID by giving it as an argument to screen -r.

### New Learnings
In this challenge we have learnt that inside a single screen session, you can have multiple windows, like your browser has multiple tabs. This can be super handy for organizing different tasks.
These windows are handled with different keyboard shortcuts, all starting with Ctrl-A:

Ctrl-A c - Create a new window
Ctrl-A n - Next window
Ctrl-A p - Previous window
Ctrl-A 0 through Ctrl-A 9 - Jump directly to window 0-9
Ctrl-A " - bring up a selection menu of all of the windows

#### Commands run: 

```sh

### New Learnings
Instead of Ctrl-A, tmux uses Ctrl-B as its command prefix.
tmux ls - List sessions
tmux attach or tmux a - Reattach to session

### New Learnings
Just like screen, tmux has windows. The key combos are different,:
Ctrl-B c - Create a new window
Ctrl-B n - Next window
Ctrl-B p - Previous window
Ctrl-B 0 through Ctrl-B 9 - Jump to window 0-9
Ctrl-B w - See a nice window picker
