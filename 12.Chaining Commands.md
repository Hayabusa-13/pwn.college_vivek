Chaining Commands 
## Challenge                                                   
1. Chaining with semicolons 
### Solve
To solve this challenge we need to chain two command using ; and then we get the flag 

#### Commands run: 

```sh
$  /challenge/pwn; /challenge/college
```
## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{4yTYOHAqaFxx6JcSZ_SNuKMoHoe.QX1UDO0wSM1AzNzEzW}
```
### New Learnings
In this we learnt ,';' separates commands in a similar way to how Enter separates lines.
Basically, when you hit Enter, your shell executes your typed command and, after that command terminates, gives you the prompt to input another command.
But with a semicolon before anything is execute we can tupe in the required commands

2. Building on Success 
### Solve
To solve this challenge we need to chain two command using the && operator and then we get the flag .
If we run them without chaining them we wont get the flag .
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ /challenge/first-success && /challenge/second
```
## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{YTroHq81yly-q9ISZK61ER7hdsb.0lM0MDOxwSM1AzNzEzW}
```
### New Learnings
The && operator allows you to run a second command only if the first command succeeds . The first command must succeed AND then the second command will run.

3. Handling Failure 
### Solve
To solve this challenge we need to chain two command using the ||operator and then we get the flag .
If we run them without chaining them we wont get the flag .

#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ /challenge/first-failure || /challenge/second
```
## Flag: 

```
 pwn.college{czie9_gA7HQst5f6S85JVMjLG2X.01M0MDOxwSM1AzNzEzW}
```
### New Learnings
The || operator allows you to run a second command only if the first command fails.
This is called the "OR" operator because either the first command succeeds OR the second command will run.

4. Your First shell script 
### Solve
To solve this we need to use the echo command to create a file named x.sh and add the two challenge commands to it. The > redirects the output of echo to create the file and then exeecute it using bash .

#### Commands run: 

```sh
$  echo "/challenge/pwn" > x.sh; echo "/challenge/college" >> x.sh
$ bash x.sh

```
## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{EpTPR-o7-o7jen9w-qSC69jOkiq.QXxcDO0wSM1AzNzEzW}
```
### New Learnings

5. Redirrecting Script Output  
### Solve
To solve this we need to use the echo command to create a file named x.sh and add the two challenge commands to it. The > redirects the output of echo to create the file and then execute it using bash and then pipe it to the required path file 
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ echo "/challenge/pwn" > x.sh; echo "/challenge/college" >> x.sh
$ bash x.sh | /challenge/solve
```

6. Executable Shell Scripts 
### Solve
In this we need to make a shell script in the home directory that has the output of /challenge/solve and then we need to make it executable using chmod command and then we can run the shell scrpit without invoking the bash command to get the flag  
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$  echo "/challenge/solve" > x.sh
$ chmod +x x.sh
$ ./x.sh
```
## Flag:

7. Understanding Shebangs 
### Solve
To solv ethis wee need to first make a shell script that has a proper shebang  and ouputs "hack the planet". And we need to make it executable using chmod command and the we can run the challenge command to get the flag 
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ echo '#!/bin/bash' > /home/hacker/solve.sh;
echo 'echo "hack the planet"' >> /home/hacker/solve.sh
$ chmod a+x solve.sh
$ /challenge/run


```
## Flag: 

```

8. Scripting with Arguments 
### Solve
To solve this challenge we need to make a shell script the reverses the arguments given by the user 
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$   echo '#!/bin/bash' > /home/hacker/solve.sh
echo 'echo "$2 $1"' >> /home/hacker/solve.sh
$ chmod +x /home/hacker/solve.sh
$ /challenge/run

```
## Flag: 

```
 pwn.college{g4zrMQaLmTdM1soXUXTZAm-oCgb.0VNzMDOxwSM1AzNzEzW}

9. Scripting With Conditionals 
### Solve
We can solve this challenge by making th e shell scrpit using if then fi such that Takes one argument
If the argument is "pwn", output "college"
For any other input, output nothing and then we can run the challenge command to get the flag 
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ echo '#!/bin/bash' > /home/hacker/solve.sh
$ echo 'if [ "$1" = "pwn" ]; then' >> /home/hacker/solve.sh
$ echo '  echo "college"' >> /home/hacker/solve.sh                   
$ echo 'fi' >> /home/hacker/solve.sh
$ chmod +x /home/hacker/solve.sh
$ /challenge/run
```

10. Scripting with Default Cases 
### Solve
To solve this challenge we need to make a shell script using if, then, else, fi that follows the following conditions :
1.Takes one argument
2.If the argument is "pwn", output "college"
3.For any other input, output "nope"
And then make it executable and then run the challenge command to get the flag 
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ echo '#!/bin/bash' > /home/hacker/solve.sh
$ echo 'if [ "$1" = "pwn" ]; then' >> /home/hacker/solve.sh
$ echo '  echo "college"' >> /home/hacker/solve.sh
$ echo 'else' >> /home/hacker/solve.sh
$ echo '  echo "nope"' >> /home/hacker/solve.sh
$ echo 'fi' >> /home/hacker/solve.sh
$ chmod +x /home/hacker/solve.sh
$ /challenge/run

```

11. Scripting with Multiple Conditions 
### Solve
To solve this challenge we need to make a shell script using if, then, else,elif, fi that follows the following conditions :
Takes one argument
If the argument is "hack", output "the planet"
If the argument is "pwn", output "college"
If the argument is "learn", output "linux"
For any other input, output "unknown
And then we need to make it executable using chmod command and then runn the challenge command to get the flag 
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ echo '#!/bin/bash' > /home/hacker/solve.sh
$ echo 'if [ "$1" = "hack" ]; then' >> /home/hacker/solve.sh
$ echo '  echo "the planet"' >> /home/hacker/solve.sh
$ echo 'elif [ "$1" = "pwn" ]; then' >> /home/hacker/solve.sh

12. Reading Shell Scripts 
### Solve
To solve we need to use the cat command to read the script of the command and find the password 
and then we need to run the command and enter the password to get the flag .
#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ cat /challenge/run
$ /challenge/run
$ hack the PLANET {Psswrd}


```
## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{8_25iN0_7pJeRQr9yGmng5cO0LA.0lMwgDOxwSM1AzNzEzW}
 ```
### New Learnings
From this challenge we have learnt that if we ever come across a situation where we are asked a passcode to get the output we can try to read the script of the command and then use the password
